## About

This repository contains the source code for home projects that I made as part of the interview process for a company. The Code contains the iPhone app which fetch restaurant location from Google API and dislay in Apple Map.

It took a total of 2 hours to prepare demo project. It was a fun challenge and I really enjoyed making the apps and learning more in the process. If I had more time, I would've improved my code even further and written more unit tests (and UI tests as well).

- The app is built using **MVC Swift** architecture and it has zero dependencies.
- Use personal swift app template availabe at github [StartKit](https://github.com/ERbittuu/StartKit)
- Use SwiftLint for lint code
